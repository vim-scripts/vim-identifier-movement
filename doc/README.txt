vim plugin, one way to improve move using "w W b B",
smartly move between language indentifier, skip language keywords,comment,strings

I became a vim user for two years, and begin to write script about 2 month ago,
if I make some mistake, please do contact me(rargo.m@gmail.com)

default key mapping:
	<C-n>	next language indentifier
	<C-p>	previous language indentifier

It may conflict with other plugin(for example, ctrlp), 
please modify it IndentifierMovement.vim

current surpport language:
	c, c++, vim, python

should be add in a couble of weeks:
	lua, ruby

It's not too hard to add a language surpport, please don't be afraid.
